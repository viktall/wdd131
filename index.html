        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Victor Ugwu. I am from Enugu state, the Eastern part of
          Nigeria. I reside in Lagos, Nigeria. I love listening to music,
          reading and writing computer codes. To learn more about programming
          and acquire a certificate, I enrolled into Brigham Young university
          -Idaho through PathwayConnect and was admitted to study software and
          web development after the successful completion of PathwayConnect. I
          am in my first year as a student and currently taking the course
          WDD131: Web dynamics Fundamentals.

          Nigeria is located on the west coast of Africa and is the most
          populous black country in the world, bordering the North Atlantic
          Ocean, between Benin and Cameroon. Nigeria covers 356,668 sq miles
          (923,7770 sq kilometers). It is about the same size as California,
          Nevada and Utah combined. Nigeria is diverse in people and culture.
          The history of the country goes back to 500 BC when the Nok people
          were the inhabitants. It was the ending of the 15th century European
          explorers and traders began their lucrative slave trade with the
          Yoruba and Benin peoples. In 1861 Lagos was colonized by the British
          and 1914, the entire country became The Colony and Protectorate of
          Nigeria. Nigeria became independent in 1960.
